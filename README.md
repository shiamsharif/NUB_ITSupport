# Django REST API with uv (Uvicorn)

This project is a Django REST API that can be run using [uv](https://www.uvicorn.org/) — a lightning-fast ASGI server for Python.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtualenv (recommended)

---

## 📦 Step 1: Install uv

You can install `uv` globally or in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install uv
````

---

## 📁 Step 2: Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

> Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with the actual repo URL.

## ⚙️ Step 3: Set Up and Run the Django Project

```bash
# Optional but recommended
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `uv` is already installed, you can run the following:

```bash
